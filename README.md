Have a hard time to get to one node from another node, and decided to go to office hour later 

Figured out how to go through to the main function node, and got the imformation from it

Started a new function call run_function

a bit confused about the parameter self in python

Can't change the tuple value that variables list of tuple

only need to finish inputi and print, others are done 


Note: parsed_program is Element, that has 
- <Element>.elem_type -> if value is program, it means this node is program node 
        # if value is func -> funciton node
- <Element>.dict contains key 
- <Element>.get(<key>)
